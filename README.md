# PythonObserverServer
Im also going to be using an MVP system to really break down what I want to do but ill make a check list for now then come back, make the read me really beautiful

Point on this is to learn more and more about netowrking techs and how python communicates from computer to computer when handling 

On launching the app, youre using CLI/CMD and when running the program youre using agrv to 'connect' to the server or chat room
I also want to make this with two different versions, one where im using frameworks and modules and one where I'm reinventing the wheel and coming to a real fundamental understanding of how the code communicates with the metal

This is also something that I want to build for the future of a much bigger project. I often think about maplestory and how that game was originally almost a chat room that was a side RPG. This technology will be implemented in some way

I believe this also needs SQLalchemy... Im not sure why but its something that I have to delve deeper into. Sucks that I dont have much time... best i make the time to really look into what i wanna do
